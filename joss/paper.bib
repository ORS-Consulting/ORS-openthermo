  abstract    = {The Hydrogen Plus Other Alternative Fuels Risk Assessment Models (HyRAM+) software has seen various improvements and additional physics capabilities since validation against experimental data was last published for HyRAM v3.1. Notably, HyRAM+ now includes four models allowing for the calculation of overpressure resulting from vapor cloud explosions from unconfined jet releases. As with the previous HyRAM validation report, validation data was gathered from available published literature and tested against HyRAM+ capabilities. The validation comparisons include tank blowdown, unignited dispersion jet plume, ignited jet flame, and enclosed accumulation and overpressure. The unconfined overpressure calculations in HyRAM+ v5.1.1 generally show good agreement with many of the experimental data sets for all four unconfined overpressure models, though HyRAM+ overpredicts the experimental data for small and cryogenic hydrogen releases. The comparisons for the other HyRAM+ physics models are largely unchanged from the previously published validation report.},
