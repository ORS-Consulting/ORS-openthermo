# Introduction
*openthermo* is an open source Python3 tool for calculation of vessel depressurization / blowdown. The main phenomena modelled are visualized in [@Fig:logo].
The thermodynamic state inside the vessel changes over time as seen from immediately observable variables temperature (T) and pressure (P).
This is caused by change in fluid inventory (density) due to flow of gas and/or liquid out of the vessel.
Further, heat is transferred from or to the surroundings via convective heat transfer on the in- and outside of the vessel with heat being conducted through the vessel wall. Due to differences in thermal resistance the vessel wall will obtain a temperature different from the fluid. Depending on the assumptions regarding the description of the fluid inside the vessel, the gas and liquid may have the same temperature (equilibrium assumption) or the two-phases may have different temperature (partial equilibrium assumption).

Temperature | K | $^\circ$ C may be used in plots
Pressure | Pa    | bar is used in plots
Mass | kg |
Volume | m$^3$ |
Time | s |
Energy | J |
Duty/power | W
Length | m
Area | m$^2$
Heat flux | W/m$^2$
Heat transfer coefficient | W/(m$^2$ K)

Density | kg/m$^3$
Heat capacity | J/(kg K)

: Unit system {#tbl:units}

As will be noted when presenting the equations implemented in the code, some of the equations utilise different units than the ones listed in [@tbl:units].
However, it is important to note that unit conversions are built in to the methods implemented, so the user shall not worry about unit conversion.

# Background
## Early works
The foundation of *openthermo* was laid by Carsten Stegelmann, more than a decade ago, who developed code for running blowdown calculations in a spreadsheet relying heavily on VBA and a legacy flash calculation routine (DLL) coded in FORTRAN by late Prof. Michael Michelsen [@michelsen_isothermal_1982;@michelsen_isothermal_1982-1]. This worked surprisingly well and executed very efficiently. The short-comings where lacking heat transfer modelling as well as an *equilibrium* only approach i.e. two-phase fluids were in full equilibrium at all times. 

## Challenges
The VBA code provided tricky to maintain in a version control system, and in the meantime the availability of high-quality thermodynamic packages for Python increased significantly. However, reimplementing an entire codebase is a time-consuming task, and this proved difficult to manage working full time as engineering consultants, and years went by without being able to fully to the long haul required. 

## Proof of concept
Having worked together in the same company, Carsten and I split ways 5 years ago. Then the Covid-19 hit and that freed up some spare time for me, staying at home without a lot of activities being possible and that lead to the development of [HydDown](https://github.com/andr1976/HydDown) [@Andreasen2021]. It started as a small spare-time project for calculation of vessel filling and depressurization behaviour. At that time the expectation was that a lot of engineering work was expected in high-pressure storage and filling stations. The work on HydDown served as a proof of concept for an efficient implementation in Python mainly provided by the [Coolprop](http://www.coolprop.org/) back-end [@doi:10.1021/ie4033999]. Eventually HydDown matured and is now in a state where it can model heat transfer in both steel and dual-layer low thermal conductivity composites during depressurisation/pressurisation. However, it cannot manage two-phase (gas/liquid) behaviour due to limitations in the flash calculation. Thus, a change in thermodynamic back-end was inevitable.

## *openthermo* development
Recently, I joined ORS Consulting with Carsten, and we revived our plans for a rigorous blowdown simulation tool. The remaining challenge was the more complex two-phase (or three-phase) flash problem and the non-equilibrium / partial equilibrium assumption. 
At all times the big inspiration has been the work done at Empirical College London, University College London and later on also Universit√† Politecnica delle Marche on the codes BLOWDOWN, BLOWSIM and VBsim, respectively. The former was also acquired by AspenTech and made available in HYSYS. Further the motivation has also been to have a tool easily accessible as a supplement to commerical (and expensive) tools. Both to reduce load on license pools, but also to provide more efficient workflows. We wanted to make the tool open source and available to the public, but license limitations on the legacy flash calculation by Prof. Michelsen required an alternative flash calculation. Several tools are now available such as Python [*thermo*](https://github.com/CalebBell/thermo) [@thermo], [NeqSim](https://equinor.github.io/neqsimhome/) [@neqsim] and [*thermopack*](https://thermotools.github.io/thermopack/) . Handling vessel depressurisation, which is effectively an UV-flash problem (Internal Energy - Volume) requires extremely many flash calculations to be performed. Thus, a fast and stable flash calculation is required. In order to provide speed and stability the preliminary choice has been [*thermopack* from SINTEF](https://thermotools.github.io/thermopack/), although it may change in the future in order to provide a three-phase (VLLE) flash.   

# Limitations and implementation details 
A few choices has been made to keep things simple:

- [*thermopack*](https://thermotools.github.io/thermopack/) [@thermopack] is used as thermodynamic backend
- Thermodynamic and transport properties (enthalpy, entropy, internal energy, liquid density, thermal conductivity, viscosity) is provided via Python *thermo* / *chemicals*.
- No temperature stratification inside bulk phases
- No temperature gradient through vessel wall. 
- Heat transfer is modelled as constant or simplified using empirical correlations
- Only single and two-phase (VLE) is handled. Three-phase (VLLE) cannot currently be modelled in the open source version.
- Currently only the Peng-Robinson (PR) [@peng_new_1976] and Soave-Redlich-Kwong [@SOAVE19721197] cubic equations of state are made available.  
- *openthermo* and it's legacy code has been built by engineers NOT software developers.  

Ignoring temperature gradients in the vessel wall is an acceptable assumption for (not too thick) steel vessel walls. However, low thermal conductivity materials cannot accurately be modelled. In order to do so a 1-D heat transfer model shall be implemented. 

One limitation of *thermopack* is that including pseudo components is not easy if the internal property calculations shall be used. Further, *thermopack* does not provide transport properties. In order to allow an implementation for pseudo components and transport properties the *thermopack* library is only used for flash calculations and used as a plugin, the rest (and less computationally demanding tasks) is provided by Python *thermo*. 

While *openthermo* has been extensively validated and fidelity has been built, we have not had the work force or man-months/years available like the legacy university projects or the commerical software providers. This means that there likely will be situations where the code fails to provide results, cases that are not covered or simply the code will not work. This is the cost and risk of using open source software.   

# Usage
When using *openthermo* a dictionary holding all relevant input in order for the program to do vessel calculations shall be provided when the main Blowdown class is initialized. The depressurisation is run by calling the class method **depressurize()** or **depressurize_euler**. 

## Basic usage
A minimal example for running *openthermo* is provided below. The example is for an isentropic blowdown i.e. with a rigorous energy and mass balance, taking into account work done by the discharged fluid, but without any heat transfer. The model assumes full equilibrium between gas and liquid (if two-phases exists at any time during the simulation). 

```python
from openthermo.vessel.blowdown import Blowdown

input = {}
P = 12e5
T = 298.15

input["mode"] = "isentropic"
input["eos_model"] = "PR"
input["liquid_density"] = "eos"
input["max_time"] = 900
input["length"] = 10
input["diameter"] = 3
input["vessel_type"] = "Flat-end"
input["orientation"] = "horizontal"
input["liquid_level"] = 1.5
input["operating_temperature"] = T
input["operating_pressure"] = P
input["ambient_temperature"] = 273
input["back_pressure"] = 1.01e5
input["bdv_orifice_size"] = 0.03  # m
input["bdv_orifice_cd"] = 0.84
input['component_names'] =  ["methane", "propane", "n-butane", "i-butane", "n-decane"]
input["molefracs"] =  [0.8, 0.05, 0.01, 0.01, 0.10]

segment = Blowdown(input)
segment.depressurize()
segment.plot()    
```

## More advanced usage
Below is a more advanced example also taking heat transfer between the vessel wall and the surroundings and from/to the vessel fluid. The model applies the partial / non-equilibrium approach between gas and liquid (if two-phase occur at any time during the blowdown). The below example is for a condensing gas initially at super-critical conditions where significant temperature difference between the gas and condensed liquid occurs during the experiment/simulation. The example is from an experiment reported by Szczepanski [@Szczepanski] and widely applied for demonstration and validation of simulation programs e.g. [@Haque1992b;@WONG;@park_numerical_2018]. 


```python
from openthermo.vessel.blowdown import Blowdown

input = {}
P = 116*1.013e5
T = 293.0

input["mode"] = "isentropic"
input["heat_transfer"] = "rigorous"
input["wall_thickness"] = 0.059  # m
input["eos_model"] = "PR"
input["liquid_density"] = "eos"
input["max_time"] = 1500
input["delay"] = 0
input["time_step"] = 10
input["length"] = 2.25
input["diameter"] = 1.13
input["vessel_type"] = "ASME F&D"
input["orientation"] = "vertical"
input["liquid_level"] = 0
input["water_level"] = 0.0
input["operating_temperature"] = T
input["operating_pressure"] = P
input["ambient_temperature"] = 293.0
input["back_pressure"] = 1.01e5
input["bdv_orifice_size"] = 0.01  # m
input["bdv_orifice_cd"] = 0.8

names = ["methane", "ethane", "propane", "n-butane"]
molefracs = [0.64, 0.06, 0.28, 0.02]

input["molefracs"] = molefracs
input["component_names"] = names

segment = Blowdown(input)
segment.depressurize_euler() 
```

## Calculation methods
The following methods are implemented:

- Isothermal: constant temperature of the fluid during depressurization 
- Adiabatic: the energy balance does not account for work done by the fluid during discharge. No heat transfer is included.  
- Isentropic: the energy balance accounts for work done by the fluid during discharge. This method can be run without or with heat transfer modelled. A variation of this method includes external backgorund heat load from a fire (pool or jet) using the Stefan-Boltzmann equation. 
- Fire: This method is a variant of the isentropic method where an API 521 pool-fire heat load is applied to the wetted surface inside the vessel. No other heat transfer is included.  

For calculations the minimal input required are:

- Initial conditions (pressure, temperature, liquid level)
- vessel dimensions (ID, length)
- orifice parameters (Cd, diameter, back-pressure)
- Calculation setup (end time)
- Fluid components and composition

For rigorous heat transfer additional input are required:

- Vessel thickness
- Vessel material heat capacity
- Vessel material density
- Ambient temperature or a Stefan-Boltzmann external fire heat load type. 

More elaborate description of the required input for the different calculation types are provided in [@Sec:input].

# Theory and methods
In this chapter the basic theory and governing equations for the model implementation in *openthermo* is presented.
The following main topics are covered:

- Thermodynamics
- Mass transfer
- Heat transfer
- Equilibrium modelling
- Vessel geometry
- Handling pseudo components

## Thermodynamics and property estimation

### Equation of state 
Currently only the Peng-Robinson [@peng_new_1976] and Soave-Redlich-Kwong [@SOAVE19721197] cubic equations of stare are available despite many being available in both *thermopack* and *thermo*. In the future more cubic equations of state may be made available. 

For more background information and theory regarding the equations of state (especially for mixtures), please refer to e.g. [*thermo* documentation](https://thermo.readthedocs.io/thermo.eos_mix.html), the [DWSIM user guide](https://github.com/DanWBR/dwsim/blob/windows/PlatformFiles/Common/docs/User_Guide.pdf), a [*thermopack* memo](https://github.com/thermotools/thermopack/blob/main/docs/memo/thermopack/thermopack2013.pdf) or textbooks such as e.g. [@sva;@Reid1987].

### Property estimation 

Property estimation is provided by the Python *thermo* package [@thermo], this includes thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy, entropy and internal energy as well as tranport properties such as thermal conductivity, viscosity and surafec tension. In general all components that are available with *thermo* can be used. Although *thermopack* comes with a smaller set of predefined components this is not limiting since *thermopack* is called with minimal input for the EOS/flash TP calculation i.e. mole fractions, critical pressure, critical temperature and accentric factor (and binary interaction parameters). Any property estimation is managed by *thermo*. 

### First law for flow process {#sec:firstlaw}
The control volume sketched in [@Fig:firstlaw], separated from the surrounding by a control surface, is used as a basis for the analysis of an open thermodynamic system with flowing streams (fs) in and out, according to [@sva]

A general mass balance or continuity equation can be written:

![Control volume with one entrance and one exit. The image has been sourced from [@firstlaw].](docs/img/First_law_open_system.png){#fig:firstlaw}

$$ \frac{m_{cv}}{dt} + \Delta \left( \dot{m} \right)_{fs}= 0 $$ {#eq:continuity}

The first term is the accumulation term i.e. the rate of change of the mass inside the control volume, $m_cv$, and the $\Delta$ in the second term represents the difference between the outflow and the inflow

$$ \Delta \left( \dot{m} \right) _{fs} = \dot{m}_2 - \dot{m}_1 $$

An energy balance for the control volume, with the first law of thermodynamics applied, needs to account for all the energy modes with can cross the control surface. Each stream has a total energy

$$ u + \frac{1}{2}w^2 + zg $$

where the first term is the specific internal energy, the second term is the kinetic energy and the last term is the potential energy.
The rate at which each stream transports energy in or out of the control volume is given by

$$ \dot{m} (u + \frac{1}{2}W^2 + zg) $$

and in total

$$  \Delta \left[ \dot{m} (U + \frac{1}{2}w^2 + zg) \right]_{fs}$$

Furthermore, work (not to be confused with shaft work) is also associated with each stream in order to move the stream into or out from the control volume (one can think of a hypothetical piston pushing the fluid at constant pressure), and the work is equal to $PV$ on the basis of the specific fluid volume.
The work rate for each stream is

$$ \dot{m}(pV) $$

and in total

$$ \Delta\left[ \dot{m}(pV) \right]_{fs} $$

Further, heat may be transferred to (or from) the control volume at a rate $\dot{Q}$ and shaft work may be applied, $\dot{W}_{shaft}$.
Combining all this with the accumulation term given by the change in total internal energy the following general energy balance can be written:

$$ \frac{d(mu)_{cv}}{dt} + \Delta \left[ \dot{m} (u + \frac{1}{2}w^2 + zg) \right]_{fs} + \Delta \left[ \dot{m}(pV) \right]_{fs} = \dot{Q} +\dot{W}_{shaft}   $$

Applying the relation $h = u + pV$, setting $\dot{W}_{shaft} = 0$ since no shaft work is applied to or extracted from the vessel, and assuming that kinetic and potential energy changes can be omitted the energy balance simplifies to:

$$ \frac{d(mu)_{cv}}{dt} + \Delta \left[ \dot{m} h \right]_{fs} = \dot{Q}  $$

The equation can be further simplified if only a single port acting as either inlet or outlet is present:

$$ \frac{d(mu)_{cv}}{dt} + \dot{m} h  = \dot{Q}  $$ {#eq:energybalance}

where the sign of $\dot{m}$ determines if the control volume is either emptied or filled.
In this case only dischartge is considered in opposition to HydDown [@Andreasen2021].
The continuity equation [@Eq:continuity] and the energy balance [@Eq:energybalance] combined with the equation of state are the key equations that shall be solved/integrated in order to calculate the change in temperature and pressure as a function of time.

If the fluid inventory is a multi-phase mixture and the discharge is only sourced from one of the phases, a mole balance is also required in addition to the energy balance and mass balnce equations above. in order to account
for the dynamical change in composition during the blowdown process. For all components, $i$,  the following balance is made where the change in total moles of component $i$ in the fluid
inventory is given by the rate of discharge of the component, which is related to the mole fraction in the vapour phase

$$ \frac{dN_i}{dt} = \dot{N_i} = \frac{\dot{m}}{M} y_i $$

In order to update the phase equilibrium i.e. account for flashing liquid (typically) or condensing gas, for each calculation step an UV-flash calculation is called with the current global composition. This is under the assumption of full thermal and compositional equilibrium between gas and liquid. In the current state of the code the PT-flash calculation provided by *thermopack* is wrapped in code solving for prescribed specific internal energy and molar volume.  

## Flow devices {#sec:flow}
### Restriction Orifice (gasseous discharge)
When a fluid flows through a restriction or opening such as an orifice, the velocity will be affected by conditions upstream and downstream.
If the upstream pressure is high enough, relative to the downstream pressure, the velocity will reach the speed of sound (Ma = 1) and the flow rate obtained will be the critical flow rate.
This condition is referred to as choked flow.
The maximum downstream pressure for the flow to still be sonic (Ma = 1), is when $P_d = P_c$.
The ratio of the critical and upstream pressure is defined by equation [@Eq:P_critical].

$$ \frac{P_{c}}{P_u}=\left (\frac{2}{k+1} \right)^\frac{k}{k-1} $$ {#eq:P_critical}

- $P_c$ is the critical pressure. [kPa]
- $P_d$ is the downstream pressure. [kPa]
- $P_u$ is the upstream pressure. [kPa]
- k is the isentropic coefficient, approximated by the ideal gas heat capacity ratio $C_p/C_v$. [-]

In order to calculate the mass flow rate through an orifice equations are used based on literature from the Committee for the Prevention of Disasters [@yellowbook].

To account for the difference in choked and non-choked flow a set limit pressure is introduced as in equation [@Eq:plimit].
If the downstream pressure, $P_{down}$, is below the pressure limit, $ P_{limit}$, then the flow is choked, and the pressure used, $P_{used}$, in equation [@Eq:massfloworifice] should be the pressure limit, $P_{limit}$.
Otherwise if the downstream pressure, $P_{down}$, is greater than or equal to the pressure limit, $P_{limit}$, the flow is no longer choked and the pressure used should be the downstream pressure, $P_{down}$ [@yellowbook].

$$ P_{limit}=P_{up} \cdot \left ( \frac{2}{k+1} \right ) ^{\frac{k}{k-1}} $$ {#eq:plimit}

$$ \dot{m}_{flow}= C_d  \cdot A \cdot\sqrt{\left ( \frac{2 k}{k-1}\right )  \cdot  P_{up} \cdot \rho \cdot \left (  \frac{P_{used}}{P_{up}} \right )^{\frac{2}{k}} \left (1-\left ( \frac{P_{used}}{P_{up}} \right ) ^{\frac{k-1}{k}} \right )} $$ {#eq:massfloworifice}

- $\rho$ is the density of the gas upstream. $[kg/m^3]$
- $P_{limit}$ is the pressure limit of the upstream absolute pressure. $[bara]$
- $P_{up}$ is the absolute pressure upstream of the orifice. $[bara]$
- $k$ is the ratio of the heat capacities at constant pressure, $C_p$, and at constant volume, $C_v$.
- $P_{down}$ is the absolute pressure downstream of the orifice. $[bara]$
- $P_{used}$ is the pressure used in the mass flow equation based on choked or non-choked conditions. $[bara]$
- $\dot{m}_{flow}$ is the mass flow through the orifice. $[kg/s]$
- $C_d$ is the discharge coefficient of the orifice opening. $[-]$
- $A$ is the cross sectional area of the orifice. $[m^2]$

### Leaks
In addition to the vapour outflow through a Blowdown valve/orifice it is also possible to include leaks. Three leak types are possible: 

- Gas/vapour
- Liquid 
- Two-phase

For gasseous leaks the methodology presented in the previous section is applied. For liquid leaks a simple Bernouilli equation is used [@yellowbook] and for two-phase a simple Fauske expression is used [@yellowbook;@worldbank]. For liquid release the assumption is that static head due to liquid level is added to the internal vessel pressure upstream the leak. 



## Heat transfer {#sec:heat}

### Natural convection
Experiments have indicated that the internal heat transfer mechanism for a vessel subject to depressurization can be well approximated by that of natural convection as found from measured Nusselt numbers being well correlated with Rayleigh number, with no apparent improvement in model performance by inclusion of the Reynolds number in the model [@woodfield].

To determine the heat transfer for the gas-wall interface, the following is applied cf. equation [@Eq:newton]:

$$\frac{dQ}{dt} = \dot{Q} = h A ( T_{s} - T_{gas} ) $$  {#eq:newton}

- $d Q$ is the change in thermal energy due to convective heat transfer. [J]
- $d t$ is the change in time during the heat transfer. [s]
- $h$ is the convective heat transfer. [W/m$$^2$$K ]
- $A$ is the area normal to the direction of the heat transfer. [m$^2$]
- $T_{s}$ is the inner surface temperature of the geometry. [K]
- $T_{gas}$ is the temperature of the bulk gas inside the vessel. [K]

The convective heat transfer will need to be estimated for the the gas-wall interface, by the use of empirical relations for the Nusselt number.
The Nusselt number describes the ratio of convective heat transfer to conductive heat transfer, normal to a surface area, as given in equation [@eq:Nu].

$$ Nu=\frac{hL}{k} $$ {#eq:Nu}

- $Nu$ is the Nusselt number. [-]
- $h$ is the convective heat transfer. [W/m$^2$K]
- $L$ is a characteristic length of the geometry. [m]
- $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the gas. [W/m$\cdot$K]

The characteristic length $L$ used is the height of the gas volume i.e. the length of a vertical vessel or the diameter of a horizontal vessel.

The empirical correlations used to calculate the Nusselt number of the gas-wall interface is a function of the Rayleigh number, which can be defined by the Grashof number and Prandtl number, as in equation [@Eq:rayleigh_gas]:

$$ Ra=Gr \cdot Pr $$ {#eq:rayleigh_gas}

- $Ra$ is the Rayleigh number. [-]
- $Gr$ is the Grashof  number. [-]
- $Pr$ is the Prandtl number. [-]

The Grashof number is a dimensionless number which approximates the ratio of the buoyancy forces to viscous forces, as given in equation [@Eq:grashof_gas}:

$$ Gr=\frac{\beta g\rho^2 L^3 \Delta T }{\mu^2} $$ {#eq:grashof_gas}

The Prandtl number is a dimensionless number defined as the ratio of the momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity, as given in equation [@Eq:prandtl_gas]:

$$ Pr=\frac{c_p \mu}{k} $$ {#eq:prandtl_gas}

- $\beta$ is the coefficient of volume expansion. [1/K]
- $g$ is the standard acceleration of gravity. [m/s$^2$]
- $\rho$ is the gas density. [kg/m$^3$]
- $L$ is the characteristic length. [m]
- $\Delta T$ is the temperature difference of the surface and gas. [K]
- $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. [kg/m$\cdot$s]
- $c_p$ is the heat capacity of gas. [J/kg$\cdot$K]
- $k$ is the thermal conductivity of gas. [J/m$\cdot$K]

It is important to note that the properties in the above equations shall be evaluated at the fluid film temperature which can be approximated by the average of the the fluid bulk temperature and the vessel wall temperature [@geankoplis].

The mechanism of heat transfer on the outside of the vessel at ambient conditions is similar to the above, but in the current version in case of ambient heat transfer a fixed coefficient of 8 W/m$^2$ K is applied. 

### Nucleate boiling heat transfer
For heat transfer between vessel wall and liquid, this is treated as nucleate boiling and estimated via the Rohsenow correlation [@rohsenow_method_1951] as implemented in the *ht* python library [@bell_calebbellht_2024].

$$
  h = {{\mu }_{L}} \Delta H_{vap} \left[ \frac{g( \rho_L-\rho_v)}
        {\sigma } \right]^{0.5}\left[\frac{C_{p,L}\Delta T_e^{2/3}}{C_{sf}
        \Delta H_{vap} Pr_L^n}\right]^3
$$


  - $\rho_L$ is the density of the liquid [kg/m$^3$]
  - $\rho_v$ is the density of the produced gas [kg/m$^3$]
  - $\mu_l$ is the viscosity of liquid [Pa s]
  - $k_l$ is the thermal conductivity of liquid [W/m K]
  - $C_{p, l}$ is the heat capacity of liquid [J/kg K]
  - $H_{vap}$ is the heat of vaporization of the fluid [J/kg]
  - $\sigma$  is the surface tension of liquid [N/m]
  - $T_e$ is the excess wall temperature, [K]
  - $C_{sf}$ is Rohsenow coefficient specific to fluid and metal [-]
  - $n$ constant, 1 for water, 1.7 (default) for other fluids usually [-]

In the present study a value of the Rohsenow coefficient of 0.013 is applied and the exponent $n$ is set to 1.7. See also [@pioro_experimental_1999;@jabardo_evaluation_2004].


### Conduction
For accurate prediction of the outer and especially the inner wall temperature for correct estimation of internal convective heat transfer and the average material temperature, the general equation of 1-D unsteady heat transfer shall be solved:

$$ \frac{\delta T}{\delta t} = \frac{k}{\rho c_p} \frac{\delta^2 T}{\delta x^2} $$

- T is temperature
- x is the spatial (1-D) coordinate
- k is the thermal conductivity
- $\rho$ is the material density
- $C_p$ is the specific heat capacity

To be solved, the initial values and boundary values must be specified.
In its default state (if thermal cobductivity is not applied for the vessel), HydDown does not include the unsteady heat transfer model, i.e. the assumption is that the temperature from outer to inner surface is uniform and equal to the average temperature.
This is obviously a crude approximation, but might be justified depending in the Biot number:

$$ Bi = \frac{hL}{k} $$

The Biot number is a simple measure of the ratio of the heat transfer resistances at the surface of a body to the inside of a body.
The ratio gives an indication to which extent the temperature will vary in space (gradient) when the body is subject to a displacement in temperature at the surface boundary layer.
Striednig *et al.* [@STRIEDNIG] concluded that for a type I (steel) cylinder the Biot number was approx. 0.03 and hence the error in assuming a uniform temperature in the vessel wall was low.

With a typical thermal conductivity of 45 $W/m K$ for steel and a heat transfer coefficient up to 600 $W/m^2 K$ [@woodfield] the Biot number for a vessel with a wall thickness of 2 cm is 0.27.
This is significantly higher than that approximated by [@STRIEDNIG].
However, the Biot number is significantly lower than 1, and the assumption of a uniform temperature is reasonable.
However, for increased wall thickness, and/or for different materials with lower thermal conductivity, the error may grow to an unacceptable level.

Especially for vessels with low conductivity materials (or very thick walls) accurate estimation of the vessel wall temperatures requires the 1-D transient heat transfer problem to be solved. 

### General fire heat loads
The heat transfer from the flame to the shell is modelled using the recommended approach from Scandpower [@scandpower] and API [@API521].
The heat transfer from the flame to the vessel shell is divided into radiation, convection, and reradiation as seen in equation [@Eq:flame]:

$$ q_f=\underbrace{{\alpha}_s \cdot {\varepsilon}_f \cdot \sigma \cdot T_{rf}^4}_\text{Radiation}+\underbrace{h_f \cdot (T_f-T_s(t))}_\text{Convection}-\underbrace{{\varepsilon}_s \cdot \sigma \cdot T_s(t)^4 }_\text{Reradiation} $$ {#eq:flame}

- $q_f$ is the flame heat flux. [W/m$^2$]
- ${\alpha}_s$ is the vessel surface absorptivity. [-]
- ${\varepsilon}_f$ is the flame emissivity. [-]
- $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\sigma$ = $5.67 \cdot 10 ^ {-8}$  [W/m$^2 \cdot$ K$^4$]
- $T_{rf}$ is the radiative flame temperature. Used for radiative heat transfer. [K]
- $T_f$ is the flame temperature engulfing the vessel. Used for convective heat transfer. [K]
- $h_f$ is the convection heat transfer coefficient between the flame and the surface. [W/m$^2 \cdot$ K]
- $T_s(t)$ is the time dependent surface temperature. [K]
- ${\varepsilon}_s$ is the surface emissivity. [-]

This model assumes that the pressure vessel is fully engulfed by the flame.
This means that the view factor for the radiation is unity and is therefore not taken into consideration.
The convective heat transfer coefficients for a jet fire and a pool fire, and recommended values for the emissivity and absorptivity, are given by Scandpower as [@scandpower]:

- $h_{jet~fire}$ = 100 [W/m$^2 \cdot$K]
- $h_{pool~fire}$ = 30 [W/m$^2 \cdot$K]
- ${\alpha}_s$ = 0.85
- ${\varepsilon}_s$ = 0.85
- ${\varepsilon}_f$ = 1.0 (optical thick flames, thickness > 1 m)

The flame temperature is found by solving equation [@Eq:flame2] for the incident heat flux in relation to the ambient conditions.
The flame temperature is kept constant throughout the simulation:

$$ q_{total}=\sigma \cdot T_{rf}^4 + h_f \cdot (T_f-T_{amb})$$ {#eq:flame2}

- $q_{total}$ is the incident flame heat flux as given in table [@Tbl:heatfluxes1]. [W/m$^2$]
- $T_{amb}$ is the ambient temperature $\approx$ 293 K (20$^\circ$ C)

The heat flux used to calculate the flame temperature is given in table [@tbl:heatfluxes1]. Different coefficient are proposed by API 521 [@API521] and this source is referenced for more information.

### API 521 pool-fire heat load
The amount of heat absorbed by a vessel exposed to an open fire is markedly affected by the type of fuel feeding the fire, the degree to which the vessel is enveloped by the flames (a function of vessel size and shape), the environment factor, firefighting, and drainage. [@Eq:API521] is used to evaluate these conditions if there are prompt firefighting efforts and drainage of flammable materials away from the vessels.


$$Q = C_1 F A_{ws}^{0.82}$$ {#eq:API521}


Where:

- $Q$ is the  total heat absorption (input) to the wetted surface, expressed in W 
- $C_1$ is a constant = 43,200 in SI units
- $F$ is an environment factor (see [@Tbl:envornmental_factors])
- $A_{ws}$ is the total wetted surface, expressed in m¬≤ 

> **Note 1:** See API 521 for guidance.  
> **Note 2:** The expression $A_{ws}^{0.82}$ is the area exposure factor or ratio. This ratio recognises that large vessels are less likely than small ones to be completely exposed to the flame of an open fire.

: Environmental factors suggested by API521 [@API521]. <sup>a</sup>  Insulation thermal conductivity divided by thickness for fire exposure conditions in W/m¬≤¬∑K The environment factor, $F$, in [@Eq:API521] and [@eq:API521_inad] does not apply to uninsulated vessels. The environment factor should be replaced by 1.0 when calculating heat input to uninsulated vessels. <sup>b</sup> See API521 for additional notes. {#tbl:envornmental_factors}

Where adequate drainage and firefighting equipment do not exist, [@eq:API521_inad] should be used:


$$ Q = C_2 \cdot F \cdot A_{ws}^{0.82} $$  {#eq:API521_inad}

Where:

- $C_2$ is a constant = 70,900 in SI units

If the ratio between fire volume and confined volume becomes large, then the use of the open pool fire equations  could underestimate the heat input to exposed equipment. In these cases, the Stefan-Boltzman methodology descibed in the previous section should be used with an increased fire temperature to account for effects of preheating and reradiation. Partial confinement can also result in higher heat fluxes and enhanced exposure of the wetted surfaces to the pool 
fire. An example is where a vessel is partially confined by adjacent embankments or walls with a height comparable to 
the vessel's height. For confined areas the conservative approach would be to apply [@eq:API521_inad]  but with the wetted area term (AWS) raised to the 1.0 
power instead of the 0.82 power and $C=108,900 W/m^2$. 

$$ Q = C_3 \cdot F \cdot A_{ws} $$  {#eq:API521_confined}

Where:
- $C_3$ is a constant = 108,900 in SI units

## Vessel geometry

All vessels modelled are assumed of cylindrical shape. The following shapes are available in *openthermo* all provided by the Python *fluids* library [@fluids]. 

- Flat-end vessel
- ASME F&D
- DIN (28011)
- 2:1 Semi-elliptical
- Hemisperical

Both ASME F&D, DIN and 2:1 semielliptical are variants of a torispherical vessel. See also the document [Calculating Tank Volume](http://www.webcalc.com.br/blog/Tank_Volume.PDF). The hemisperical ends are half-speres extending one radius out.

: Vessel geometry details. For torispherical tank heads, the following *f* and *k* parameters are used in standards [@fluids]. *f* is the dish-radius parameter for tanks with torispherical heads or bottoms, *k* is the knuckle-radius parameter for tanks with torispherical heads or bottoms {#tbl:vessel_geometry}

Using the *fluids* library partial volumes, surface area (full and partial) and liquid level (from partial volume) can be calculated and used internally in *openthermo*.

## Model implementation
Two main implementations have been made, which are referred to as *homogeneous equilibrium* or *full equilibrium* and *partial phase equilibrium* (PPE), which will be further elaborated in the following.

### Full equilibrium 
In the full/homogeneous equilibrium (HE) concept it is assumed that any phase will be in full equilibrium with the other phases and that there is a uniform pressure and temperature throughout all phases. 
However, in the case of both vapour and liquid being present, different vessel wall temperatures will be solved for. The ordinary differential equations (mass, energy, mole and wall temperatures) are solved using the *dopri5* method [@dormand_family_1980;@dopri_1993], which is an explicit Runge-Kutta method of order (4)5 as provided in *scipy* [@2020SciPy-NMeth].
In each time step, using the input for component moles and total internal energy an UV-flash is solved in order to estimate the the pressure and temperature as well as phase split and properties for each phase. 
The UV-flash is obtained by formulating a minimisation problem around the standard PT-flash, iteratively solving for pressure and temperature while minimizing the error in internal energy and molar volume using a Nelder-Mead algorithm [@gao_implementing_2012] as provided by *scipy* [@2020SciPy-NMeth].
Using the estimated liquid content (if any) the wetted surface area can be estimated and the heat transfer to both liquid and vapour can be estimated. With the vapour properties the mass discharge rate can be calculated.
Thus, all derivatives can be quantified and passed to the Runge-Kutta solver. In the homogenous equilibrium approach the density of the liquid phase 
can be estimated both by the equation of state or using the COSTALD method [@hankinson_new_1979] for saturated liquids for a more realistic liquid density.

### Partial phase equilibrium
The concept of partial phase equilibrium (PPE) was first introduced by Speranza and
Terenzi [@speranza_blowdown_2005] in order to describe the non-equilibrium between
the phases during the blowdown process and further refined by Ricci *et al.* [@ricci_unsteady_2015]  and Terenzi *et al.* [@dalessandro_modelling_2015]. 

In the PPE approach the fluid in the vessel is divided in two different zones during the blowdown : zone **V** (vapour phase) and zone **L** (liquid phase). See also [@Fig:logo]. In order to account for the mass and energy exchanged
between the liquid and vapour phases, it is necessary to introduce
two new phases **v** and **l**. In the following **v** and **l** phases are denoted as
**child** phases while **V** and **L** will be named **parent phases**.
The child phase **v** is formed (as bubbles) from the liquid parent (**L**) vaporization while
the child phase **l** is formed from the parent vapour (**V**) condensation (as droplets).
It is assumed that the new phase **v** is in phase equilibrium
with the liquid **L** and likewise that the new phase **l** is in phase
equilibrium with the gas (bulk) **V**. 
While the child phases may physically appear as droplets in the gas phase and bubbles in the liquid phase and have
a significant lifetime during settling/buoyant rising, for the calculation purpose they are assumed to form and immediately drop
  and homogenize in their corresponding bulk phase (actually within each major time step).  Thus, the droplets will drop immediately into
the liquid (bulk), while the vapour (bubbles) will immediately rise
into the gas (bulk) phase.  

Consequently, it is possible to consider the
whole system as split into two partial sub-system **V+l** and **L+v**,
constituted of one **parent** (the bulk phase) and one **child** phase.
The whole idea of the child phases is to enable mass and energy exchange between the parent
phases and account for thermal non-equilibrium as simple as possible.

Following the conceptualisation of the partial phase equilibrium, the mass and energy conservation can be described [@speranza_blowdown_2005;@ricci_unsteady_2015;@dalessandro_modelling_2015;@park_numerical_2018] with separate mass conservation equations for vapour and liquid phase. See also [@AndreasenStegelmann] for a write-up of the differential energy and continuity equations 
to be integrated. 

The solution strategy for the partial phase equilibrium differs somewhat from the homogeneous equilibrium. Instead of the adaptive step size Runge-Kutta method a very simple explicit Euler method with fixed time step is applied. This is mainly due to the solving of the source terms of vapour condensation and liquid evaporation within each time step. As previously described, it is assumed that the equilibrium between parent and child phase is instantaneous. Thus, the moles transported between each main phase is quantifiable, 
but in order to estimate the rate of the mass transfer, the time step must be exactly known. For numerical stability a relaxation factor of 0.9 is applied to the condensation / evaporation rates. 

Further, a combined UV-flash is solved for each phase at each time step. However, while the total volume is known from the vessel volume, the exact volume of each phase is not known before-hand. Thus, the two UV-flashes are linked by the total volume, given by the volume of the liquid and the volume of gas which must equal the vessel volume.
Further, they are linked by a common pressure, while the temperature in each phase is allowed to differ. 

## Handling pseudo components
Oil fractions above C7+ are typically lumped into a limited number of pseudo components in order to reduce complexity. This is typically done based on boiling point ranges. In *openthermo* pseudo components can be defined based on *True boiling point* and *Specific gravity*. With these two properties the following properties are estimated internally: 

- Critical pressure
- Critical temperature
- Critical compressibility 
- Critical molar volume
- Acentric factor
- Molecular weight 
- HC-ratio 

### Critical pressure 
The critical pressure $P_c$ is estimated the Kesler-Lee correlation [@kesler1976improve;@ahmed2007equations].

$$\ln(P_c) = 8.3634 - \frac{0.0566}{SG} - \left[0.24244 + \frac{2.2898}
        {SG} + \frac{0.11857}{SG^2}\right]10^{-3}T_b
        + \left[1.4685 + \frac{3.648}{SG} + \frac{0.47227}{SG^2}\right]
        10^{-7}T_b^2-\left[0.42019 + \frac{1.6977}{SG^2}\right]10^{-10}T_b^3$$

Where
- SG is the Specific gravity of the fluid at 60 degrees Farenheight [-]
- Tb is the Boiling point the fluid [K]
- Pc is the critical pressure [Pa]

### Critical temperature
The critical temperature is estimated the Kesler-Lee correlation [@kesler1976improve;@ahmed2007equations].

$$T_c = 341.7 + 811.1SG + [0.4244 + 0.1174SG]T_b
        + \frac{[0.4669 - 3.26238SG]10^5}{T_b}$$

Where
- SG is the Specific gravity of the fluid at 60 degrees Farenheight [-]
- Tb is the Boiling point the fluid [K]
- Tc is the crtical temperature [K]

### Acentric factor
The accentric factor is estimated the Kesler-Lee correlation [@kesler1976improve;@ahmed2007equations].

For Tbr > 0.8:

$$\omega = -7.904 + 0.1352K - 0.007465K^2 + 8.359T_{br}
        + ([1.408-0.01063K]/T_{br})$$

Otherwise:
$$\omega = \frac{-\ln\frac{P_c}{14.7} - 5.92714 + \frac{6.09648}{T_{br}}
        + 1.28862\ln T_{br} - 0.169347T_{br}^6}{15.2518 - \frac{15.6875}{T_{br}}
         - 13.4721\ln T_{br} + 0.43577T_{br}^6}$$

$$K = \frac{T_b^{1/3}}{SG}$$

$$T_{br} = \frac{T_b}{T_c}$$

where 

- SG is the Specific gravity of the fluid at 60 degrees Farenheight [-]
- Tb is the Boiling point the fluid [K]
- Tc is the Estimated critical temperature [K]
- Pc is the Estimated critical pressure [Pa]

### Critical compressibility 
The function calculating critical compresibility [-] for pseudo components is  based on [@lee1975generalized].

$$Z_c = 0.2905 - 0.085 * \omega$$

Where: 
- $\omega$ is accentric factor
- $Z_c$ is the critical compressibility 

### Critical molar volume
The function calculates critical volume for pseudo components based on definition of compresibility.

 $$Vc = \frac{Z_c T_c * 8.314}{P_c}$$

 Where:
 - Tc is the Estimated critical temperature [K]
 - Pc is the Estimated critical pressure [Pa]
 - Zc is the Estimated critical compressibility
 - Vc is the Estimated critical molar volume [m3/mol]


### Molecular weight 
The molecular weight is estimated the Kesler-Lee correlation [@kesler1976improve;@ahmed2007equations].

$$MW = -12272.6 + 9486.4SG + [4.6523 - 3.3287SG]T_b + [1-0.77084SG
        - 0.02058SG^2]\left[1.3437 - \frac{720.79}{T_b}\right]\frac{10^7}{T_b}
        + [1-0.80882SG + 0.02226SG^2][1.8828 - \frac{181.98}{T_b}]
        \frac{10^{12}}{T_b^3}$$

Where
- SG is the Specific gravity of the fluid at 60 degrees Farenheight [-]
- Tb is the Boiling point the fluid [K]

### HC-ratio 
The HC atomic ratio is estimated according to [@riazi1986prediction;riazi2005characterization].

The CH weight ratio (Carbon-to-hydrogen ratio) is calculated from:

$$CH = 8.7743\cdot10^{-10} \right[ \exp{7.176 \cdot 10^{-3}T_b + 30.06242 SG -7.35\cdot 10^{-3} Tb SG} \left] Tb^{-0.98445}SG^{-18.2753}$$

The Hydrogen-to-Carbon ratio is calculated from:

$$HC_atomic_ratio = 11.9147 / CH$$

Where: 
- SG is the Specific gravity of the fluid at 60 degrees Farenheight [-]
- Tb is the Boiling point the fluid [K]


# Supplementing examples 
In general for validation against experiments the paper [@AndreasenStegelmann] which can also be accessed in the [preprint](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-00xzc-v2) is referred. The code for running the simulations matching the experiments are all included in the *test* folder in the [GitHUb repo](https://github.com/ORS-Consulting/ORS-openthermo/tree/main/tests) in the file *test-blowdown.py*. A few additional examples and validation cases supplementing these are presented in the following. 

## API 521 pool fire 
A fictive example is made for an API 521 pool fire scenario for a horizontal vessel (ID 3 m/TT 10 m) half full of liquid. The input details are provided below. The simulation results are compared to simulations performed with the legacy depressuring utility in HYSYS. The results are shown in [@Fig:API521_mdot], [@Fig:API521_pres] and [@Fig:API521_temp]. As seen the match between the two programs is excellent. When applying the API 521 pool fire the heat load is added directly to the vessel inventory and vessel wall material temperature is not solved for. In the below example the heat load is applied to the wetted surface area (default setting).

```python
from openthermo.vessel.blowdown import Blowdown

input = {}
P = 12e5
T = 298.15

input["mode"] = "fire"
input["drain_fire_fighting"] = "Inadequate"

input["liquid_level"] = 1.5

input["bdv_orifice_size"] = 0.03  # m

input['component_names'] =  ["methane", "propane", "n-butane", "i-butane", "n-decane"]
input["molefracs"] =  [0.8, 0.05, 0.01, 0.01, 0.10]

segment = Blowdown(input)
segment.depressurize()

## Stefan-Boltzmann fire heat load
The example as investigated in the previous section is modified and subject to a Stefan-Boltzmann fire heat load, in this case a jet fire backgorund heat load according to the Scandpower guideline [@scandpower]. 
The full input is listed below. As seen the composition of the fluid is different from above.  
The simulation results are compared to simulations performed with the EO Blowodwn utility in Unisim Design. The results are shown in [@Fig:SB_mdot], [@Fig:SB_pres] and [@Fig:SB_temp]. As seen the agreement is generally very good. 
The difference between the two codes is mainly interms of the wall heat transfer modelling and the phase equilibrium. In the EO blowdown tool heat conduction thorugh the wall is modelled and there is a differece between the innner and outer wall temperature. This illustrates when the assumption of a uniform wall temperature works well and when it works less well. For the wall in contact with vapour the assumption applied in *openthermo* works very well, since the gradient thorugh the wall is small. For the wall in contact with liquid some discrepancy is observed especially for the outside temperature, although in this case it is of less importance compared to the much higher wall temperature (and more pronounced thermal weakening) for the part in contact with vapour. The EO Blowdown tool also applies a Non-equilibrium/partial equilibrium approch as *openthermo*. However, in *openthermo* the partial equilibirum approach is not yet combinable with the Stefan-Boltzmann fire heat load method. Despite this difference in equilibrium modelling the results are indeed comparable. 


```python

input["mode"] = "isentropic"
input["heat_transfer"] = "rigorous_sb_fire"

The heat flux for the Stefan-Boltzmann case for both wetted and unwetted wall is displayed in [@Fig:SB_heat_flux]. As seen the heat flux decreases as the wall temperature increses (lower convective heat transfer and more back-radiation). This is more pronounced for the unwetted wall, since it increases more in temperature due to lower heat tranfer rate internally. It is also noted that as the wetted wall increases in temperature the heat transfer rate also increases significantly, which is due to the nucleate boiling heat transfer type. This signigficant increase in heat transfer is responsible for the more moderate temeprature increase of the wetted vessel wall temperature. Eventually the nucleate boiling heat transfer becomes comparable to the external heat transfer rate.
